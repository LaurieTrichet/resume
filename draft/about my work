I have being working on iOS and Android apps for a bit more than 4 years, in a big insurance company and in a mobile development studio. I used to work on several projects at the same time, alone or in team. I was also lead developer on projects for which I have done specifications, software architecture documents, REST web services design. I was consulted to do workload estimations on new and ongoing projects. Furthermore, I have managed on site, remote and offshore teams. I also used to be the client's main technical contact of my projects. I will be able to lead a project.

Because I take ownership on my projects, I always give the best of myself. I like to work in the best conditions, so I am very organized. I use continuous integration and ticketing software. I believe it is mandatory to work with unit testing, UI testing and code reviews because it prevents regressions and improves the overall quality of the project. I will participate to create robust and maintainable apps.

My biggest projects were newspaper apps, for smartphones and tablets on iOS and Android. On which I had to deal with legacy server APIs, or not in sync with specifications. There was a big audience for those apps so there were high volumes of data, synchronization problematics. In addition of the mostly used external frameworks for networking, formatting, etc... I am familiar with integration of third-party libraries for ads, in app purchase, magazine reader and statistics. All the apps I have made have push notifications. I have designed those apps to capitalize on the components used on both smartphone and tablet. Those apps are/were 4 stared, NouvelObs and TeleObs, linked in my resume. I will be able to handle complex mobile applications and lead them to a successful publication on stores.
